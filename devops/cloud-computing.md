# CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage, processing, database or infrastructure), as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for individuals to self-manage physical resources themselves (On-Premises infrastructure), and only pay for what they use.
